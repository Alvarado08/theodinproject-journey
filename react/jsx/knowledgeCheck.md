## What is JSX?

It's essentially writing HTML inside JavaScript

## Why do we use JSX?

Writing JSX helps us separate the logic and markup of our code (separation of concerns), in a way, in a single file (component)

## What are the three rules of JSX?

* Return a single root element. This can be a `<div>`. In case a container is not wanted, return a fragment `<></>`
* Close all tags
* camelCase most things. JSX turns into JavaScript, and attributes of elements become keys of JavaScript objects, so you canâ€™t use dashes or reserved words such as class
