# Knowledge Check

## What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
**Understand the problem, plan, divide and conquer**
## Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
**To understand what you are trying to accomplish**
## What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
**Explain it to someone**
## What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
**Know what youâ€™re aiming to solve. Consider interface, inputs and output**
## What is an algorithm?
**The recipie or solution to a problem**
## What is pseudocode?
**Writing out the logic in natural language instead of code in order to think through the steps of a program**
## What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
**It's a better way of dealing with complexity. Reveals the next step/subproblem that should be solved from the big problem**
