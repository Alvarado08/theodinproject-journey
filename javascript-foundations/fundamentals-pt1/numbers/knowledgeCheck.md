# Knowledge Check
## Name three ways to declare a variable
**var, let and const**
## Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
**var due to different behavior**
## What rules should you follow when naming variables?
**First character must not start with a number and can only contain the $ and _ characters**
## What happens when you add numbers and strings together?
**They are concatenated or joined into a single string**
## How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?
**Returns the remainder of a division**
## Explain the difference between == and ===
**A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion. For a strict equality, check ===**
## When would you receive a NaN result?
**NaN is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number. Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number)**
## How do you increment and decrement a number?
**With ++ to increment 1 and -- to decrement by 1. An example is counter++ and counter--**
## Explain the difference between prefixing and postfixing increment/decrement operators
**The prefix form is when the operator goes before the variable. ++counter for example. It returns the new value. The postfix form is when the operator goes after the variable. For example counter++. It returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement)**
## What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
**The default priority order of operators. What we learned in school. Every operator has a corresponding precedence number. The one with the larger number executes first. If the precedence is the same, the execution order is from left to right**
## How do you access developer tools and the console?
**By right-clicking on a blank webpage and selecting “Inspect” or “Inspect Element”. In the ‘Developer Tools’ pane, find and select the "Console" tab, where you should see the output of the console.log statement**
## How do you log information to the console?
**With console.log()**
## What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers? eg. +”10”
**Converts it to a numeric value**
