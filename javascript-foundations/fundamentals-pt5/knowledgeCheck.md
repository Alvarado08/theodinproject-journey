## What is the difference between objects and arrays?
**Objects store properties as a key-value pair whereas arrays don't. These property keys must be strings or symbols and their values can be of any type. However, arrays are basically objects but store their data in ordered collections** 

## How do you access object properties?
**You can use dot or bracket notation. Bracket notation gives you more flexibility mainly because you can store object properties in variables and can be used dynamically**

## What is Array.prototype.map() useful for?
**It works as a for loop. Iterating through the items. Returns a new array**

## What is Array.prototype.reduce() useful for?
**It works with an accumulator and currentItem iteration in its first parameter. And you usually assign a 0 as the second parameter to initialize property. This is as if working with a for loop and storing a total sum value**
